# MiniLearn
On-Device Learning for Low-Power IoT Devices

This is a repor for the paper Minilearn as part of International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Network (EWSN) 2022

I'm using the CMSIS-NN libray as submodule, you should clone using git clone --recurse-submodules or if you already cloned use git submodule update --init --recursive

I have create a simplified version that can be compiled on local computer, if you need to cross-compile there board specific steps to follow.

There are three examples for three datasets: CIFAR10, WISDM (HAR), and google keyspotting.
